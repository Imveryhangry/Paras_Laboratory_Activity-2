1. I chose Encapsulation and Abstraction to focus on the game and to protect and maintain the code for its functionality by restricting direct access. This game is a simple roulette and only shows the essential features necessary to play.

2. In this game you are given $20 as a starting balance, the role of exception handling is to prevent the player to enter more bet than their remaining balance. It has a restriction on what number you can pick to avoid errors and has a game over feature if your balance goes 0 or empty.

3. This has limited balance which only allows you to play if you still have a balance. It could be improved if you add functions such as deposit and withdraw to allow you to play the game even if you lose all your balance or withdraw the balance you have. Having a registration system which allows more unique player to play the game and have fun. Adding Polymorphism features to make the code more seamless and readable.
